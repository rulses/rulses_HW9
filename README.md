The form elements, including labels, checkboxes, and radio buttons, are properly associated with their respective inputs. Required attributes ensure that users must select an option before procedding.

From a user experience perspective, the form prevents unnecessary page reloads by using JavaScript to handle submissions dynamically. Bootstrapâ€™s built-in classes ensures consistent spacing, alignment, and visual appeal, while JavaScript is used effectively to enforce user input without disrupting the flow of interaction.
